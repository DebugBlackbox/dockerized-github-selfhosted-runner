# Override count:  docker compose up --scale runner=N -d
# Stop all:        docker compose down

    # Each container gets Docker's auto-assigned unique hostname so GitHub
    # registers them as separate runners (runner-1, runner-2, runner-3 …).
    # Do NOT set a static hostname here — all replicas would share the same
    # name and keep overwriting each other on the GitHub runner dashboard.
